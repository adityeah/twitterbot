  "readme": "# wordfilter\n\nA small module meant for use in text generators that lets you filter strings for bad words.\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install wordfilter`\n\n```javascript\nvar wordfilter = require('wordfilter');\nwordfilter.blacklisted('does this string have a bad word in it?'); // \"false\"\n\n// clear the list entirely\nwordfilter.clearList();\n\n// add new words\nwordfilter.addWords(['zebra','elephant']);\nwordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it'); // \"true\"\n\n// remove a word\nwordfilter.removeWord('zebra');\nwordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it'); // \"false\"\n```\n\nOr with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom lib.wordfilter import Wordfilter\nwordfilter = Wordfilter()\nwordfilter.blacklisted('does this string have a bad word in it?')  # False\n\n# clear the list entirely\nwordfilter.clearList()\n\n# add new words\nwordfilter.addWords(['zebra','elephant'])\nwordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it')  # True\n```\n\n## Documentation\nThis is a word filter adapted from code that I use in a lot of my twitter bots. It is based on [a list of words that I've hand-picked](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/blob/master/lib/badwords.json) for exclusion from my bots: essentially, it's a list of things that I would not say myself. Generally speaking, they are \"words of oppression\", aka racist/sexist/ableist things that I would not say.\n\nThe list is not all-inclusive, and I'm always adding words to it. If you'd like to file an issue or a pull request to add more words, please do so, but understand that this is primarily for use in my own projects, and I may not agree to add certain words. (For example, I have no problem with scatological words, so \"shit\" and \"fuck\" will never be on this list.)\n\nWords are case insensitive.\n\nAlso note that due to the complexities of the English language, I am considering anything containing the substring of a bad word to be blacklisted. For example, even though \"homogenous\" is not a bad word, it contains the substring \"homo\" and it gets filtered. The reason for this is that new slang pops up all the time using compound words and I can't possibly keep up with it. I'm willing to lose a few words like \"homogenous\" and \"Pakistan\" in order to avoid false negatives.\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013 Darius Kazemi\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
